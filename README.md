# MVC-Project
A small project that incorporates MVC architecture into a sudoku solver
The App has an initial page just to showcase routing capabilities.
On clicking the link, the UI for a sudoku solver is displayed. The solver can be used to generate solutions, given a user input of a sudoku puzzle. It can also be used to validate if a given puzzle can be solved or not.
Below the puzzle is a timer, that can be started, stopped and reset based on user requirement. It acts more of as a timer to check how fast the user can solve a puzzle.
The project also tracks how long the algorithm takes to solve a puzzle and the number of backtracks it takes and displays it in the web browser console.
